# Product Cult üó≥Ô∏è A Hope AI Example Project 

[![License: Apache 2.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache_2.0-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)

Welcome to **Product Cult**! This is a fully functional example application generated using [**Hope AI**](https://bit.cloud) and refined by humans. It demonstrates how to compose a modern web application from independent, reusable components. The app itself is a fun platform where users can vote for their favorite next-generation product ideas.

This project serves as a practical guide to showcase AI-driven development, modular architecture, and rapid delivery with Hope AI.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This project is built with a modern, component-oriented technology stack:

* **Monorepo:** [Bit](https://bit.dev) - For creating, versioning, and composing the platform packages.
* **Core Platform:** Used [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Harmony](https://bit.dev/docs/harmony-intro) for composing and integrating the application's services and logic.
* **Frontend:** [React](https://reactjs.org/) - For building interactive and reusable UI components.
* **Styling:** CSS Modules - For locally scoped and conflict-free component styles.
* **Backend:** [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) backend with [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) data fetching. Data persisted to [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com). 
* **Code standards:** Unit tests powered by [Vitest](https://vitest.dev). Code consistency and quality enforced by [ESLint](https://eslint.org).

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the Product Cult platform running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Bit](https://bit.dev/docs/getting-started/installing-bit/installing-bit) installed globally on your system.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository** (or get the source code).
2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd path/to/product-cult
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies** for all components in the workspace:
    ```bash
    bit install
    ```

## Running the App

You can run the full application or view individual components in the Bit workspace.
This command builds and runs the main `product-cult` application, showing you the final, composed product.

```bash
bit run product-cult
```
Now, open your browser to the specified local port to see the app live!

### Start the Workspace Preview

This command launches the Bit development server, where you can see, test, and interact with each component in isolation. It's great for development and debugging.

```bash
bit start
```

## üìÇ Project Structure

The directory structure is organized by components, not by file type. This makes the codebase more modular, scalable, and easier to maintain. Enable, add or disable application features in the [app composition file](https://github.com/teambit/product-cult/blob/main/product-hunt-platform/product-hunt/product-hunt.bit-app.ts)
