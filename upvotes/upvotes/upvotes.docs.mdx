The Upvotes aspect provides functionality for users to upvote items such as products and launches. It includes APIs for creating, deleting, listing, and counting upvotes, as well as checking a user's upvote status.

## Usage Examples

### Displaying an Upvote Button

This example demonstrates how to display an upvote button for a specific product. This assumes you have a component that consumes the `UpvoteButton` slot.

```jsx
// Implement your UI component to render the button here
function ProductUpvoteButton({ itemId, itemType, size }) {
  // Consume the UpvoteButton slot to retrieve the appropriate button configuration
  return (
    <button onClick={() => alert('Upvote clicked for item: ' + itemId)}>
      Upvote ({itemId} - {itemType})
    </button>
  );
}
<ProductUpvoteButton itemId="product-123" itemType="product" size={24} />
```
### Displaying the Upvote Count
This example demonstrates how to display the number of upvotes for a specific launch. This assumes you have a component that consumes the `UpvoteCount` slot.
```jsx
// Implement your UI component to render the count here
function LaunchUpvoteCount({ itemId, itemType }) {
  // Consume the UpvoteCount slot to retrieve the current count
  const upvoteCount = 150; // Replace with actual count from your data source
  return (
    <span>
      {upvoteCount} Upvotes for launch {itemId} ({itemType})
    </span>
  );
}
<LaunchUpvoteCount itemId="launch-456" itemType="launch" />
```
### Displaying a List of User Upvoted Products
This example demonstrates how to display a list of products that a user has upvoted. This assumes you have a component that consumes the `UserUpvotedItemsList` slot.
```jsx
function UserUpvotedProducts({ userId, itemType }) {
  // Consume the UserUpvotedItemsListSlot to retrieve the list of items
  const upvotedProducts = [
    { id: 'product-1', name: 'Awesome Product 1' },
    { id: 'product-2', name: 'Incredible Product 2' },
  ]; // Replace with actual data from your data source
  return (
    <ul>
      {upvotedProducts.map((product) => (
        <li key={product.id}>{product.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
<UserUpvotedProducts userId="user-789" itemType="product" />
