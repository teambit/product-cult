The `UpvoteButton` component allows users to express their appreciation for items by upvoting them. It displays the current upvote count and reflects the user's vote status with an icon.

## Usage

Here are a few examples of how to use the `UpvoteButton` component.

### Default State

This example demonstrates the button in its default state, where the user has not yet upvoted the item.

```jsx
<UpvoteButton itemId="product-123" itemType="product" initialCount={42} />
```

### Initially Upvoted

This example shows the button in a state where the user has already upvoted the item.

```jsx
<UpvoteButton
  itemId="product-456"
  itemType="product"
  initialCount={99}
  initialHasUpvoted={true}
/>
```

### Custom Styling

This example demonstrates how to use CSS classes to customize the appearance of the button.

```jsx
<UpvoteButton
  itemId="product-789"
  itemType="product"
  initialCount={123}
  className="custom-upvote-button"
/>
