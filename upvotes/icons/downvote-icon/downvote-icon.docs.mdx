The `DownvoteIcon` component renders a down arrow icon, often used to indicate disapproval or disagreement.
It can be styled and customized with different sizes and active states.

## Basic Downvote Icon

The basic `DownvoteIcon` displays a static downvote icon.
The `isActive` prop determines whether the icon is filled (active) or outlined (inactive).

```jsx
<DownvoteIcon />
```

## Active and Inactive States

The `isActive` prop is used to toggle the visual state of the icon.

```jsx
<DownvoteIcon isActive={true} />
```

```jsx
<DownvoteIcon isActive={false} />
```

## Downvote Icon Sizes

The size of the `DownvoteIcon` can be adjusted using the `size` prop.
You can use numbers or relative units, such as `em`.

```jsx
<DownvoteIcon size={16} />
```

```jsx
<DownvoteIcon size={32} />
```

```jsx
<DownvoteIcon size="2em" />
```

## Clickable Downvote Icon

The `onClick` prop enables the icon to be clickable, triggering an action when pressed.
This example demonstrates toggling the active state on click.

```jsx
<DownvoteIcon onClick={() => alert('Downvote clicked!')} />
