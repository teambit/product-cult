`UpvoteIcon` is a component that provides a visual representation of an upvote action. It includes `isActive` state.

## Default and Active States

This example demonstrates the `UpvoteIcon` in both its default (inactive) and active states. The active state is visually distinct, typically using a theme's primary color to indicate that the item has been upvoted.

```jsx
<div style={{ display: 'flex', gap: 'var(--spacing-medium)' }}>
  <UpvoteIcon />
  <UpvoteIcon isActive={true} />
</div>
```
## Different Sizes
The `UpvoteIcon` component can be rendered in different sizes, using either pixel values or relative units like `em`. This allows the icon to be adapted to various contexts and screen sizes.
```jsx
<div style={{ display: 'flex', gap: 'var(--spacing-medium)' }}>
  <UpvoteIcon size={16} />
  <UpvoteIcon size={24} />
  <UpvoteIcon size={32} />
  <UpvoteIcon size="2em" />
</div>
```
## Interactive Upvote Icon
This example shows how to use the `UpvoteIcon` in an interactive scenario where clicking the icon toggles the upvote status and updates a vote count.
```jsx
<>
  <div style={{ display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center', gap: 'var(--spacing-small)' }}>
    <UpvoteIcon isActive={true} onClick={() => {}} size={28} />
    <span>42</span>
  </div>
  <div>
    Click the icon to toggle upvote status.
  </div>
