The `Upvote` component represents a user's vote on a specific item, such as a product or launch. It includes details like the user ID, item ID, item type, and the timestamp of the vote.

## Get started

Install and use the component in your code:

```ts
const upvote = Upvote.from({
  id: 'unique-upvote-id',
  userId: 'user123',
  itemId: 'product456',
  itemType: 'product',
  createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
});
```

## Mock data

You can use mock data for development and testing purposes using the `mockUpvote` and `mockUpvotes` APIs.

```ts
const singleUpvote = mockUpvote();
console.log(singleUpvote);

const multipleUpvotes = mockUpvotes();
console.log(multipleUpvotes);
```

## Usage examples

### Displaying Upvote Information

This example demonstrates how to create and display basic upvote information.

```ts
const upvote = Upvote.from({
    id: 'upvote-001',
    userId: 'user-001',
    itemId: 'product-001',
    itemType: 'product',
    createdAt: new Date().toISOString()
});
console.log(upvote.toObject());
```

### Mock Upvote Example

Shows how to generate a mock upvote using the `mockUpvote` function. This is useful for generating test data or populating a UI with placeholder data.

```ts
const mock = mockUpvote();
console.log(mock.toObject());
```

### Mock Upvotes Example

Shows how to generate an array of mock upvotes using the `mockUpvotes` function.  This is useful for generating lists of upvotes for testing or demonstration purposes.

```ts
const mocks = mockUpvotes();
mocks.forEach(upvote => console.log(upvote.toObject()));
