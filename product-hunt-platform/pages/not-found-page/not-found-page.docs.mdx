The `NotFoundPage` component provides a visually appealing and informative way to handle 404 errors in your application. It displays an image, a clear message, and a link back to the homepage or another specified route.

## Basic Usage

This example shows the default `NotFoundPage` component with its standard image, title, message, and link.

```jsx
<NotFoundPage />
```
## Customized Message
You can customize the title, message, and link text to better suit your application's branding and user experience.
```jsx
<NotFoundPage
  titleText="Oops! Lost in Space?"
  messageText="The page you're looking for seems to have vanished. Let's get you back on track."
  linkText="Return to Base"
/>
```
## Custom Image and Route
This example demonstrates how to use a custom image and change the route the user is directed to when clicking the link.
```jsx
<NotFoundPage
  imageUrl="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1518020382113-a7e8fc38eac9?auto=format&fit=crop&w=400"
  imageAltText="A dog looking lost"
  homePageRoute="/products"
