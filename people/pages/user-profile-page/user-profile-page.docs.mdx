The `UserProfilePage` component displays a user's profile, including their basic information and optional tabs for additional content.
It fetches user data using a hook and allows users to view their own profile or the profiles of others.

## Basic Usage

A basic example of displaying a user profile. This will fetch and display the user's name, bio, and other details.

```jsx
<UserProfilePage userId="user123" />
```

## User Profile with Tabs

This example shows how to add custom tabs to the user profile page. Each tab can display different types of content, such as the user's products or activity.

```jsx
const tabs = [
  {
    name: 'products',
    label: 'Products',
    component: () => <div>Products Content</div>,
  },
  {
    name: 'activity',
    label: 'Activity',
    component: () => <div>Activity Content</div>,
  },
];

<UserProfilePage userId="user456" tabs={tabs} />
```

## Displaying Own User Profile

When the `userId` prop is not provided, the component attempts to display the profile of the currently authenticated user.
This is useful for creating a "My Profile" page where users can view their own information.

```jsx
<UserProfilePage />
