The `UserIcon` component provides a simple, consistent way to display a user icon in your application. It's based on a standard user silhouette and can be easily customized with different sizes and colors.

## Basic User Icon

This example shows the default `UserIcon` component.

```tsx
<UserIcon />
```
## Customized User Icon
You can customize the size and color of the `UserIcon` using the `size` and `color` props.
```tsx
<UserIcon size={32} color="var(--colors-primary-default)" />
```
## Interactive User Icon
The `UserIcon` can be made interactive by adding an `onClick` handler and a `title` for accessibility.
```tsx
<UserIcon
  onClick={() => alert('User profile clicked!')}
  title="View User Profile"
  style={{ cursor: 'pointer' }}
/>
