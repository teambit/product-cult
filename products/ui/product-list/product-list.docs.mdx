## Component Usage

The `ProductList` component displays a list of product cards in a grid layout. It accepts an array of `Product` objects as props.
It supports displaying a loading state, an empty state, and an error state.

## Examples

### Populated Product List

This example demonstrates the `ProductList` component with a list of mock products.

```jsx
<MockProvider>
  <ProductList initialProducts={mockProducts} categoryId="all-tech" />
</MockProvider>
```
### Empty Product List with Custom Message
This example shows how to use the `emptyState` prop to display a custom message when there are no products to display.
```jsx
<MockProvider>
  <ProductList initialProducts={[]} categoryId="rare-items" emptyState={<CustomEmptyState />} />
</MockProvider>
```
### Product List with Custom Loading State
This example demonstrates how to use the `loadingState` prop to display a custom loading indicator while products are being fetched.
```jsx
<MockProvider>
  <ProductList categoryId="newly-launched" loadingState={<CustomLoadingState />} />
</MockProvider>
