This component registers the "products" search type, enabling product-specific search functionality within the application. It includes a configuration entry (`productSearchTypeEntry`) and a UI component (`ProductSearchSpecificUI`) that is rendered when the "products" search type is active.

## Basic Usage

This example shows how to use the `ProductSearchType` component to register the product content type with the search aspect.
To make `ProductSearchType` and `productSearchTypeEntry` available, you would typically import them from `'./product-search-type.js'`.

```js
// Example of registering the search type (assuming productSearchTypeEntry is imported):
// import { SearchBrowser } from '@infinity/search.search';
// SearchBrowser.registerSearchTypeComponent(productSearchTypeEntry);

// Example of rendering the ProductSearchType component (assuming ProductSearchType is imported):
<ProductSearchType />
```

## Standalone Product Search UI

This example demonstrates the `ProductSearchSpecificUI` component in isolation, which is the UI rendered when the "products" search type is active.
The `productSearchTypeEntry` (which you would import from `'./product-search-type.js'`) provides access to this UI component.

```js
// Assuming productSearchTypeEntry is imported and available
const SpecificUIComponent = productSearchTypeEntry.component;

<SpecificUIComponent />
```

## Customizing the Product Search UI

The `ProductSearchSpecificUI` component can be customized with CSS classes and styles.
Again, you would access `productSearchTypeEntry.component` after importing `productSearchTypeEntry`.

```js
// Assuming productSearchTypeEntry is imported and available
const SpecificUIComponent = productSearchTypeEntry.component;

<SpecificUIComponent className="custom-class" style={{ backgroundColor: 'var(--colors-surface-secondary)' }} />
