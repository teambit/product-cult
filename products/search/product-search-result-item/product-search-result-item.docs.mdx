## Component Usage

The `ProductSearchResultItem` component displays a single product item within a list of search results. It includes an image, title, and description, linking to the product's detail page.

## Basic Example

This example shows a basic usage of the `ProductSearchResultItem` component with a search result object.

```jsx
<ProductSearchResultItem
  searchResult={{
    id: "prod-app-1",
    title: "AI Powered Code Assistant Pro",
    description: "Revolutionize your development workflow with our AI-powered code assistant.",
    type: "product",
    data: { id: "ai-code-assist-pro-001", category: "Developer Tools", price: "29.99/month" },
    imageUrl: "https://example.com/image.jpg",
  }}
/>
```

## Product Item Without Image

This example demonstrates how the `ProductSearchResultItem` handles cases where the image URL is not provided.

```jsx
<ProductSearchResultItem
  searchResult={{
    id: "prod-gadget-2",
    title: "Stealth Mode Smart Ring v2",
    description: "The next generation sleek smart ring that tracks your activity, sleep, and notifications discreetly.",
    type: "product",
    data: { id: "smart-ring-stealth-v2-789", category: "Wearables", releaseDate: "Q1 2025" },
    imageUrl: undefined,
  }}
/>
```

## Long Text and Truncation

This example tests how the component handles long text for both the title and description, ensuring proper truncation.

```jsx
<ProductSearchResultItem
  searchResult={{
    id: "prod-platform-3",
    title: "The Ultimate Next-Generation Collaborative Productivity Platform for Modern Distributed Teams: Enhancing Workflow Efficiency and Streamlining Global Communication Across All Enterprise Verticals Using Advanced AI and Secure Cloud Technologies",
