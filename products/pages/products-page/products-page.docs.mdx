The `ProductsPage` component provides a structured layout for displaying a list of products, with built-in support for custom headers, footers, loading states, and empty states. It leverages the `ProductList` component to render the product items.

## Usage

To use the `ProductsPage` component, you need to provide a title, meta description, and category ID.  Optionally, you can provide an initial list of products, custom header, custom footer, custom empty state, and custom loading state.

```jsx
<ProductsPage
  title="Featured Products"
  metaDescription="Explore our featured product listings."
  categoryId="featured"
  initialProducts={mockProducts}
/>
```
## With Custom Header and Footer
You can customize the header and footer of the `ProductsPage` component by passing in React nodes to the `header` and `footer` props.
```jsx
<ProductsPage
  title="New Arrivals"
  metaDescription="Check out our latest product arrivals."
  categoryId="new-arrivals"
  header={<div>Custom Header</div>}
  footer={<div>Custom Footer</div>}
  initialProducts={mockProducts}
/>
```
## Handling Empty State
When there are no products to display, you can use the `customEmptyState` prop to render a custom component.
```jsx
<ProductsPage
  title="No Products Found"
  metaDescription="There are no products in this category."
  categoryId="empty"
  initialProducts={[]}
  customEmptyState={<div>No products found.</div>}
/>
