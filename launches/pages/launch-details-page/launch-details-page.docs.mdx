The `LaunchDetailsPage` component fetches launch data and displays details such as name, tagline, description, launch date, and a countdown timer.

## Usage

To use the `LaunchDetailsPage` component, you need to provide a `launchId` via the URL parameters. The component then fetches the launch data and displays it.

```jsx
<LaunchDetailsPage />
```
## Upcoming Launch Example
This example demonstrates the `LaunchDetailsPage` component displaying details for an upcoming launch. It includes a countdown timer and a tracking button.
```jsx
<MockProvider>
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/launch/:launchId" element={<LaunchDetailsPage mockLaunchData={upcomingLaunchData} />} />
  </Routes>
  <Navigate to={`/launch/${upcomingLaunchData.id}`} replace />
</MockProvider>
```
## Past Launch Example
This example showcases the `LaunchDetailsPage` component displaying details for a past launch. It indicates that the launch is already live.
```jsx
<MockProvider>
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/launch/:launchId" element={<LaunchDetailsPage mockLaunchData={alreadyLaunchedData} />} />
  </Routes>
  <Navigate to={`/launch/${alreadyLaunchedData.id}`} replace />
</MockProvider>
```
## Error State Example
This example shows the `LaunchDetailsPage` component in an error state when no `launchId` is provided. It displays an error message indicating that the launch was not found.
```jsx
<MockProvider>
  <Routes>
    {/* This route configuration ensures `launchId` from `useParams` will be undefined */}
    <Route path="/some/other/path/without/id" element={<LaunchDetailsPage />} />
  </Routes>
  {/* Navigate to the path where LaunchDetailsPage is rendered without a launchId in params and no mock data */}
  <Navigate to="/some/other/path/without/id" replace />
</MockProvider>
