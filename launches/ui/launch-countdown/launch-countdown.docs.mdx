The `LaunchCountdown` component displays a countdown timer to a specific launch date. It updates every second and shows a message once the launch time is reached.

## Basic Usage

This example shows the basic usage of the `LaunchCountdown` component, counting down to a specified launch date.

```jsx
<LaunchCountdown
  launchDate={new Date(new Date().getTime() + 60000).toISOString()}
  title="Upcoming Launch"
/>
```
## Custom Messages
Customize the title and launched message to fit your application's theme.
```jsx
<LaunchCountdown
  launchDate={new Date(new Date().getTime() + 30000).toISOString()}
  title="New Product Release"
  launchedMessage="Product is now live!"
/>
```
## Launched State
When the launch date has passed, the component displays a custom "launched" message.
```jsx
<LaunchCountdown
  launchDate={new Date(new Date().getTime() - 1000).toISOString()}
  title="Past Launch"
  launchedMessage="Already Launched!"
/>
