## EditLaunch Component

The `EditLaunch` component provides an interface for administrators to modify existing product launch details. It fetches the launch information based on the `launchId` obtained from the URL parameters.

## Usage

The component is designed to be used within an admin panel or a protected route, ensuring that only authorized users can access and modify launch data. It includes form validation and handles the submission process to update the launch details.

## Examples

### Editing an Existing Launch

This example demonstrates how to use the `EditLaunch` component to modify the details of an existing product launch. It assumes that the component is rendered within a `MemoryRouter` context with a route that includes the `launchId` parameter.

```jsx
<MemoryRouter initialEntries={['/launches/launch-demo-123/edit']}>
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/launches/:launchId/edit" element={<EditLaunch />} />
  </Routes>
</MemoryRouter>
```
### Handling Missing Launch ID
This example shows the component's behavior when the `launchId` is missing from the URL. In this scenario, the component displays an error message indicating that the launch ID is required to edit a launch.
```jsx
<MemoryRouter initialEntries={['/launches/edit']}>
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/launches/edit" element={<EditLaunch />} />
  </Routes>
</MemoryRouter>
```
### Submitting the Form
When the form is submitted, the `EditLaunch` component triggers an update mutation. It shows "Updating..." while the mutation is in progress, and "Update Launch" otherwise
```jsx
<MemoryRouter initialEntries={['/launches/launch-demo-123/edit']}>
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/launches/:launchId/edit" element={<EditLaunch />} />
  </Routes>
</MemoryRouter>
