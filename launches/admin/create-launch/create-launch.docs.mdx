The `CreateLaunchPage` component provides a form for submitting new product launches to the platform. It includes fields for the launch name, tagline, description, product ID, and launch date.

## Basic Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use the `CreateLaunchPage` component:

```jsx
<CreateLaunchPage />
```
This will render a form with the necessary fields for creating a new launch.
## Custom Styling
You can customize the styling of the `CreateLaunchPage` component by passing a `className` prop:
```jsx
<CreateLaunchPage className="custom-class" />
```
You can also pass inline styles using the `style` prop:
```jsx
<CreateLaunchPage style={{ backgroundColor: 'var(--colors-background-secondary)' }} />
```
## Handling Form Submission
The `CreateLaunchPage` component handles form submission internally, using the `useCreateLaunch` hook to send the data to the server.  On successful submission, a success message is displayed, and the user is redirected to the newly created launch page. Error messages are displayed for unsuccessful submissions.
