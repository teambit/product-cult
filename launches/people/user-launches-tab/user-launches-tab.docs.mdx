The `UserLaunchesTab` component is used within a user's profile to showcase the product launches they have submitted. It handles data fetching, loading, error, and empty states.

## Usage

### Displaying User Launches

This example shows how to use the `UserLaunchesTab` component to display a list of launches submitted by a user.  The `userId` prop is used to filter the launches.

```jsx
<UserLaunchesTab userId="some-user-id" />
```

### Handling Loading State

The component displays a loading indicator while fetching data.

```jsx
<UserLaunchesTab userId="loading-user" />
```

### Handling Error State

If there's an error during data fetching, the component displays an error message.

```jsx
<UserLaunchesTab userId="error-user" />
```

### Handling Empty State

If the user has not submitted any launches, the component displays an empty state message, which is managed internally by the `LaunchList` component.

```jsx
<UserLaunchesTab userId="empty-user" />
