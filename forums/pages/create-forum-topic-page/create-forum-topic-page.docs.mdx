The `CreateForumTopicPage` component allows authenticated users to create new topics in a selected forum. It includes a form with fields for topic title, content, and forum selection.

## Basic Usage

This example demonstrates the basic usage of the `CreateForumTopicPage` component. It renders a form that allows users to enter a title and content for their topic, and select a forum from a list.

```jsx
<CreateForumTopicPage
  onTopicCreated={(topicId) => {
    // eslint-disable-next-line no-alert
    alert(`Topic created with ID: ${topicId}`);
  }}
/>
```
## Handling Topic Creation
The `onTopicCreated` prop allows you to handle the successful creation of a topic. In this example, we display an alert with the ID of the newly created topic.
```jsx
<CreateForumTopicPage
  onTopicCreated={(topicId) => {
    // eslint-disable-next-line no-alert
    alert(`Topic created successfully! ID: ${topicId}`);
    // You can also navigate to the new topic page here
  }}
/>
```
## Custom Styling
You can customize the appearance of the `CreateForumTopicPage` component by applying custom CSS classes.
```jsx
<CreateForumTopicPage
  className="my-custom-class"
  onTopicCreated={(topicId) => {
    // eslint-disable-next-line no-alert
    alert(`Topic created successfully! ID: ${topicId}`);
  }}
/>
