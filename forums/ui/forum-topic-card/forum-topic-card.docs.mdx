## Component usage

The `ForumTopicCard` component is used to display a brief overview of a forum topic. It includes the topic's title, author, a snippet of the content, and the date it was created.

```jsx
<ForumTopicCard topic={topic} mockAuthorProfile={author} />
```
## Basic Example
This example demonstrates the basic usage of the `ForumTopicCard` component with mock data for both the topic and the author. This is useful for displaying a simple, static card.
```jsx
const mockAuthor = {
  userId: 'user-alice-001',
  name: 'Alice Coder',
  imageUrl: 'https://example.com/alice.jpg',
  bio: 'Full-stack developer',
  createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
};
const mockTopic = {
  forumId: 'ph-forum-general',
  title: 'Seeking Advice: Best Practices for Scaling a Node.js Application',
  content: 'Our Node.js application is experiencing rapid growth, and we need to ensure it can handle the increasing load.',
  userId: mockAuthor.userId,
  createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
  updatedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
  id: 'topic-123',
};
<ForumTopicCard topic={mockTopic} mockAuthorProfile={mockAuthor} />
```
## Long Text Handling
This example shows how the `ForumTopicCard` handles long titles and content excerpts. The component automatically truncates the text and adds an ellipsis to ensure the card remains visually appealing.
```jsx
const longAuthor = {
  userId: 'user-bob-002',
  name: 'Robert The Innovator P. Longname Jr. Esq.',
  imageUrl: 'https://example.com/bob.jpg',
  bio: 'Serial entrepreneur and product visionary.',
  createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
};
const longTopic = {
  forumId: 'ph-forum-strategy',
  title: 'A Comprehensive Long-Winded Title Discussing the Future of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)',
  content: 'This is an exceptionally detailed and lengthy piece of content designed to test the excerpt generation. We are exploring how DAOs might reshape traditional governance...',
  userId: longAuthor.userId,
  createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
  updatedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
  id: 'topic-456',
};
<ForumTopicCard topic={longTopic} mockAuthorProfile={longAuthor} />
```
## Author Loading and Unknown States
This example demonstrates the card's behavior when author information is not immediately available. It simulates a loading state and an "Author unknown" state when the user profile cannot be fetched.
```jsx
const topicWithUnknownAuthor = {
  forumId: 'ph-forum-discussion',
  title: 'Open Discussion: What Excites You Most About AI in 2025?',
  content: 'Let\'s have an open discussion about the future of AI. What specific advancements, applications, or ethical considerations are on your mind as we look towards 2025?',
  userId: 'user-charlie-unmocked-003', // This ID won't have a mockAuthorProfile passed
  createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
  updatedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
  id: 'topic-789',
};
<ForumTopicCard topic={topicWithUnknownAuthor} />
