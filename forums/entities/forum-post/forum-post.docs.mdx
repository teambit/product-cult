## Get started

The `ForumPost` entity is used to represent individual posts within a forum.
It includes details such as the content of the post, the author, and the creation date.
It supports serialization and deserialization, making it suitable for both backend and frontend use.

```ts
const post = ForumPost.from({
  topicId: 'topic123',
  content: 'Hello everyone!',
  userId: 'user456'
});
```

## Creating a Forum Post

Use the `ForumPost.from()` method to create a new forum post.
This method accepts a plain object containing the post's data.

```ts
const newPost = ForumPost.from({
  topicId: 'general-discussion',
  content: 'What are your thoughts on the new feature?',
  userId: 'user789'
});
console.log(newPost);
```

## Mock Data

Use the `mockForumPost` and `mockForumPosts` functions to generate mock data for development and testing.

```ts
const singlePost = mockForumPost();
console.log(singlePost);
const multiplePosts = mockForumPosts();
console.log(multiplePosts);
```

## Serializing a Forum Post

Use the `toObject()` method to serialize a `ForumPost` instance into a plain JavaScript object.

```ts
const post = mockForumPost();
const plainObject = post.toObject();
console.log(plainObject);
