A component for a Forum entity, supporting serialization and de-serialization of Forum objects.

## Get started

Install and use the component:

```ts
// import { Forum } from './forum.js'; // Removed as per "Delete docs import statements" rule
// Assuming Forum is available in the scope or imported elsewhere in a real project context.
const now = new Date().toISOString();
const forum = Forum.from({
  id: '123',
  name: 'General Discussion',
  description: 'A place to discuss general topics.',
  createdAt: now,
  updatedAt: now,
});
```

## Mock data

Use mock data for development and testing purposes with the `mockForums` API.

```ts
// import { mockForums } from './forum.mock.js'; // Removed as per "Delete docs import statements" rule
// Assuming mockForums is available in the scope or imported elsewhere in a real project context.
const forums = mockForums();
console.log(forums);
```

## Creating a Forum

Demonstrates how to create a Forum instance.

```ts
// import { Forum } from './forum.js'; // Removed as per "Delete docs import statements" rule
// Assuming Forum is available in the scope or imported elsewhere in a real project context.
const now = new Date().toISOString();
const forum = new Forum(
  'Community Lounge',
  'A relaxed space for casual conversations.',
  now,
  now,
);
console.log(forum.toObject());
```

## Using mockForums with Overrides

Shows how to override properties of mock forums.

```ts
// import { mockForums } from './forum.mock.js'; // Removed as per "Delete docs import statements" rule
// Assuming mockForums is available in the scope or imported elsewhere in a real project context.
const now = new Date().toISOString();
const forums = mockForums([{ name: 'Custom Forum', description: 'Custom description', createdAt: now, updatedAt: now }]);
console.log(forums[0].toObject());
