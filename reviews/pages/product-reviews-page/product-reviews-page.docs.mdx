The `ProductReviewsPage` component displays a list of reviews for a given product. It fetches the reviews based on the `productId` prop and renders them using the `ReviewList` component.

## Usage

To use the `ProductReviewsPage` component, you need to provide a `productId`. Optionally, you can pass `mockReviews` for testing or storybook purposes.

```jsx
<ProductReviewsPage productId="prod-123" />
```
## Example with Sample Reviews
This example shows the `ProductReviewsPage` with a list of mock reviews. This is useful for testing and development purposes.
```jsx
const sampleReviews = [
  {
    id: 'rev-001',
    productId: 'prod-airpods-case-001',
    userId: 'user-reviewer-alice-123',
    rating: 5,
    comment: 'Absolutely fantastic product!',
    createdAt: new Date('2024-07-22T10:30:00.000Z').toISOString(),
    updatedAt: new Date('2024-07-22T11:00:00.000Z').toISOString(),
    status: 'approved',
  },
];
<ProductReviewsPage productId="prod-airpods-case-001" mockReviews={sampleReviews} />
```
## Example with No Reviews
This example shows the `ProductReviewsPage` when there are no reviews for a product. This demonstrates the component's ability to handle empty review lists gracefully.
```jsx
<ProductReviewsPage productId="prod-newly-launched-002" mockReviews={[]} />
```
## Example with Loading State
This example demonstrates the `ProductReviewsPage`'s behavior while attempting to fetch data.  Without providing `mockReviews`, the component initiates an internal data fetch, showcasing the loading state.
```jsx
<ProductReviewsPage productId="prod-live-data-fetch-003" />
