## Component Overview

The `ReviewCard` component provides a structured and visually appealing way to display user reviews. It includes the author's avatar, name, review date, rating (in stars), and the review comment itself.

## Basic Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use the `ReviewCard` component with a mock review object:

```jsx
const review = {
  id: 'review-123',
  productId: 'product-456',
  userId: 'user-789',
  rating: 4,
  comment: 'This product is great! I really enjoyed using it.',
  createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
  updatedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
  status: 'approved',
};
<ReviewCard review={review} />
```
In this example, the `ReviewCard` will display the review content along with the author information (if available) and a star rating.
## Displaying a Review with a Long Comment
The component handles long comments gracefully by wrapping the text.
```jsx
const reviewWithLongComment = {
  id: 'review-456',
  productId: 'product-789',
  userId: 'user-101',
  rating: 5,
  comment: 'This is a really long comment to test how the review card handles text wrapping. I want to make sure the text does not overflow and that it looks good on different screen sizes. Overall, I am very happy with this product, and I would recommend it to others.',
  createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
  updatedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
  status: 'approved',
};
<ReviewCard review={reviewWithLongComment} />
```
## Handling Different Ratings
The `ReviewCard` component visually represents the rating using star symbols.
```jsx
const lowRatingReview = {
  id: 'review-789',
  productId: 'product-123',
  userId: 'user-456',
  rating: 1,
  comment: 'This product did not meet my expectations.',
  createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
  updatedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
  status: 'approved',
};
<ReviewCard review={lowRatingReview} />
```
This example demonstrates how a low rating is displayed using a single filled star and four empty stars.
