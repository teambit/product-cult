The `ManageReviewsPage` component provides an interface for administrators to moderate user-submitted reviews. It displays a list of reviews and allows for actions such as approving, rejecting, or deleting them.

## Basic Usage

This example demonstrates how to render the `ManageReviewsPage` with mock data for demonstration purposes. In a real application, the review data would be fetched from an API.

```js
<ManageReviewsPage mockReviewsData={[
  {
    id: '1',
    productId: 'prod1',
    userId: 'user1',
    rating: 5,
    comment: 'Great product!',
    createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
    updatedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
    status: 'pending',
  },
]} />
```

## Handling No Reviews

This example shows the `ManageReviewsPage` displaying a message when there are no reviews to moderate. This is useful for informing the administrator that no action is required at the moment.

```js
<ManageReviewsPage mockReviewsData={[]} />
```

## Displaying Pending Reviews

This example filters and displays only reviews that are in a 'pending' state, allowing administrators to focus on reviews that require immediate attention.

```js
const pendingReviews = [
  {
    id: '2',
    productId: 'prod2',
    userId: 'user2',
    rating: 3,
    comment: 'Not bad, but could be better.',
    createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
    updatedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
    status: 'pending',
  },
];

<ManageReviewsPage mockReviewsData={pendingReviews} />
