The Reviews aspect allows users to submit reviews for products, view existing reviews, and provides moderation tools for managing these reviews. It integrates with products and user profiles to provide a comprehensive review system.

## Usage Examples

### Displaying Product Reviews

To display reviews for a specific product, you can use the `listReviews` query.
The query accepts `productId` to filter reviews for specific products.

```graphql
query ListProductReviews {
  listReviews(options: {
    productId: "product123"
  }) {
    id
    productId
    userId
    rating
    comment
    createdAt
    updatedAt
    status
  }
}
```

### Submitting a Review

Users can submit a review for a product using the `createReview` mutation. The mutation requires a `productId`, `rating`, and `comment`. Users must be authenticated to submit a review.

```graphql
mutation CreateNewReview {
  createReview(options: {
    productId: "product456"
    rating: 5
    comment: "This product is amazing! Highly recommended."
  }) {
    id
    productId
    userId
    rating
    comment
    createdAt
    updatedAt
    status
  }
}
```

### Moderating a Review

Administrators can moderate reviews using the `moderateReview` mutation. This allows them to approve or reject reviews based on content guidelines. The mutation requires the `id` of the review and the desired `status` ('approved' or 'rejected').

```graphql
mutation ModerateExistingReview {
  moderateReview(options: {
    id: "review789"
    status: "approved"
  }) {
    id
    productId
    userId
    rating
    comment
    createdAt
    updatedAt
    status
  }
}
