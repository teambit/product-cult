labels: ['review', 'entity']
---

A component for a product Review entity, supports serialization and de-serialization of Review objects and can be used from
both backend and frontend.

## Get started

Install and use the component in your code:

```ts
// const { Review } = require('@bit/review'); // Or your configured path
// Assuming Review is available or imported as shown in your project's setup.
const review = Review.from({
  id: 'review-123',
  productId: 'product-456',
  userId: 'user-789',
  rating: 4,
  comment: 'I really enjoyed this product!',
  createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
  updatedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
  status: 'approved'
});
```

## Mock data

You can use review mock data for development and testing purposes using the `mockReview` and `mockReviews` APIs.

```ts
// Assuming mockReview and mockReviews are available or imported.
const review = mockReview();
console.log(review);
const reviews = mockReviews();
console.log(reviews);
```

## Usage examples

### Creating a Review Object

This example demonstrates how to create a new `Review` object using the `Review.from()` method.

```ts
// Assuming Review is available or imported.
const reviewData = {
  id: 'review-456',
  productId: 'product-789',
  userId: 'user-101',
  rating: 5,
  comment: 'The best product ever!',
  createdAt: '2024-01-01T12:00:00.000Z',
  updatedAt: '2024-01-02T12:00:00.000Z',
  status: 'approved'
};
const review = Review.from(reviewData);
console.log(review.toObject());
```

### Using Mock Reviews

This example shows how to use `mockReview` to generate a mock review for testing or development.

```ts
// Assuming mockReview is available or imported.
const mock = mockReview({ comment: 'Custom comment for testing.' });
console.log(mock.toObject());
```

### Displaying a Review

This example shows how to display a review.
The Review component receives review data as props and renders the details.

```tsx
// Assuming you have a Review display component (e.g., in React)
// and mockReview is available or imported.
const review = mockReview();

const ReviewComponent = ({ review }) => (
  <div>
    <h3>Review for Product: {review.productId}</h3>
    <p>Rating: {review.rating}</p>
    <p>{review.comment}</p>
  </div>
);

// Example usage of the display component:
// <ReviewComponent review={review} />;
