The `SectionLayout` component is designed to structure content on a page, providing a consistent layout with optional titles, captions, and subtitles.

## Basic Usage

This example demonstrates a basic section with just content.

```jsx
<SectionLayout>
  <Paragraph>
    This is a basic section with content. You can add any content you like here, such as paragraphs, images, or other components.
  </Paragraph>
</SectionLayout>
```

## Section with Title and Subtitle

This example shows how to add a title and subtitle to the section.

```jsx
<SectionLayout
  title="Section Title"
  subtitle="A brief description of the section's content."
>
  <Paragraph>
    This section has a title and subtitle, providing context for the content below.
  </Paragraph>
</SectionLayout>
```

## Custom Title and Styling

This example demonstrates using custom nodes for the title and adding a custom class name for styling.

```jsx
<SectionLayout
  title={<Heading level={3}>Custom Title</Heading>}
  className="custom-section"
>
  <Paragraph>
    This section uses a custom title node and has a custom class name applied for unique styling.
  </Paragraph>
</SectionLayout>
