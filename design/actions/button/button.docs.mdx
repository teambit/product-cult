description: A versatile and accessible button component that prioritizes user experience and visual consistency.
labels: ['button', 'ui', 'navigation']
---

The Button component can render as a standard HTML button or as a link (anchor tag) with button styling if an `href` is provided.
Supports multiple visual appearances (primary, secondary, tertiary) and a disabled state.

## Button Appearances

The Button component supports different appearances to convey the importance or context of the action.

```jsx
<Button appearance="primary">Primary</Button>
<Button appearance="secondary">Secondary</Button>
<Button appearance="tertiary">Tertiary</Button>
```

## Button as a Link

When the `href` prop is provided, the Button component renders as a link, allowing navigation to other pages or resources.

```jsx
<Button href="/products" appearance="primary">
  View Products
</Button>
```

## Disabled Button

The `disabled` prop disables the Button component, preventing user interaction and visually indicating its inactive state.

```jsx
<Button disabled appearance="primary">
  Add to cart
</Button>
