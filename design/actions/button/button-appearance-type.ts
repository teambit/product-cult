 * Defines the visual appearance styles for the Button component.
 * 'primary': Main action button, typically with a solid background and high contrast text.
 * 'secondary': Secondary action, often an outlined button or one with a lighter background than primary.
 * 'tertiary': Least prominent action, styled subtly, often like a text link or ghost button, for less critical actions.
