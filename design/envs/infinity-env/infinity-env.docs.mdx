A configurable environment that streamlines React development within the Infinity ecosystem. It provides tools, configurations, and theming necessary for building reusable and consistent components.

Features include:
- Ready-to-use configurations for React, TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, and testing with Vitest.
- Integration with the Infinity design system via the `InfinityTheme` provider.
- Streamlined component previews and testing.

## Using the Infinity Environment

To leverage the Infinity environment, configure your workspace and components as follows:

### Workspace Configuration

Update your `workspace.jsonc` file to include the Infinity environment:

```json
{
  "teambit.generator/generator": {
    "envs": [
      "my-org.design/infinity-env"
    ]
  }
}
```
### Applying to a Component
Apply the Infinity environment to a specific component using the `bit env set` command:
```shell
bit env set ui/button my-org.design/infinity-env
```
This command configures the `ui/button` component to use the settings and dependencies defined in the Infinity environment.
### Theming Example
The `InfinityEnvProvider` automatically wraps component previews with the `InfinityTheme`, ensuring visual consistency. Here's how you might define a simple component:
```jsx
function MyComponent({ text }) {
  return (
    <div>
      {text}
    </div>
  );
}
```
In a composition file, you can then render this component, and it will automatically be themed:
```jsx
/* MyComponent.composition.tsx */
function MyComponentComposition() {
  return <MyComponent text="Hello from Infinity!" />;
}
export default MyComponentComposition;
```
### Customizing Configurations
While the Infinity environment provides a solid foundation, you can further customize it by:
- Overriding configuration files like `tsconfig.json`, `eslint.config.js`, and `prettier.config.js`.
- Modifying the `preview/mounter.tsx` file to add additional context providers.
