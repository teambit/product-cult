The `Link` component facilitates seamless navigation both within your application (using React Router) and to external websites. It also re-exports useful React Router hooks.

## Internal Navigation

Use the `Link` component for navigating between routes within your application. Ensure your application is wrapped with React Router's `BrowserRouter` or `MemoryRouter`.

```jsx
<MemoryRouter initialEntries={['/']}>
  <Link href="/products">Go to Products Page</Link>
</MemoryRouter>
```
This creates a link that, when clicked, navigates the user to the `/products` route within your application.
## External Links
To create a link that directs users to an external website, set the `external` prop to `true`. This will render a standard HTML `<a>` tag with appropriate attributes.
```jsx
<Link href="https://www.producthunt.com" external>
  Visit Product Hunt
</Link>
```
By default, external links open in a new tab for a better user experience.
## Custom Styling and Click Handling
You can customize the appearance of the `Link` component using CSS classes via the `className` prop. Additionally, you can intercept click events using the `onClick` prop to implement custom logic.
```jsx
<MemoryRouter initialEntries={['/']}>
  <Link href="/launches" className="custom-link" onClick={(event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    // eslint-disable-next-line no-alert
    alert('Navigating to launches!');
  }}>
    View Launches
  </Link>
</MemoryRouter>
```
This example demonstrates how to prevent the default navigation behavior and execute custom JavaScript code when the link is clicked.
## React Router Hooks
The `Link` component re-exports the following React Router hooks, making them readily available for use in your components:
- `useLocation`: Returns the current location object.
- `useParams`: Returns an object of key/value pairs of URL parameters.
- `useNavigate`: Returns a function that programmatically navigates the user.
- `useSearchQuery`: Returns the URL's query parameters.
These hooks allow you to access and manipulate the application's routing state directly, facilitating dynamic and context-aware navigation experiences.
