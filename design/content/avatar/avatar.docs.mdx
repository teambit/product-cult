The Avatar component is used to represent users or entities with a profile picture or initials. It supports different sizes, shapes, and fallback mechanisms.

## Basic Usage

Displaying an avatar with an image source and alt text:

```jsx
<Avatar src="https://example.com/user.jpg" alt="John Doe" />
```
## Avatar with Initials
When an image source is not available, the component can display initials derived from the `alt` prop or provided via the `initials` prop:
```jsx
<Avatar initials="JD" alt="John Doe" />
```
If only `alt` is provided, the component will extract the first letters of the first two words:
```jsx
<Avatar alt="John Doe" />
```
## Avatar Sizes and Shapes
The Avatar component supports different sizes and shapes:
```jsx
<Avatar size="small" shape="circle" alt="Small Circle" />
<Avatar size="medium" shape="square" alt="Medium Square" />
<Avatar size="large" shape="circle" alt="Large Circle" />
<Avatar size="xlarge" shape="square" alt="XLarge Square" />
