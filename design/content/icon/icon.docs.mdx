The `Icon` component is a versatile base for rendering SVG icons, handling common properties like size, color, and accessibility.
Specific icon components should use this as a foundation, providing their SVG paths as children.

## Basic Usage

This example demonstrates how to use the `Icon` component with a custom SVG path.

```jsx
<Icon>
  <path d="M10 20v-6h4v6h5v-8h3L12 3 2 12h3v8z" />
</Icon>
```

## Customizing Size and Color

You can easily customize the size and color of the icon using the `size` and `color` props.

```jsx
<Icon size={32} color="red">
  <path d="M10 20v-6h4v6h5v-8h3L12 3 2 12h3v8z" />
</Icon>
```

## Adding a Title for Accessibility

For better accessibility, you can add a descriptive title to the icon using the `title` prop.
This will render an SVG `<title>` element and set the appropriate ARIA attributes.

```jsx
<Icon title="Home">
  <path d="M10 20v-6h4v6h5v-8h3L12 3 2 12h3v8z" />
</Icon>
